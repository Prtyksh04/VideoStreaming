The whole magic happens in the ffmpegCommand variable. It contains the command to convert the video to HLS format using ffmpeg. The -codec:v and -codec:a options specify the video and audio codecs to use, respectively. The -hls_time option sets the time between each HLS segment, and the -hls_playlist_type vod option specifies that the HLS playlist is a VOD (Variable Bitrate) playlist. The -hls_segment_filename option specifies the filename pattern for each HLS segment, and the -start_number 0 option starts the segment numbering at 0. Finally, the ${hlsPath} variable is used to construct the full path to the HLS playlist file.
